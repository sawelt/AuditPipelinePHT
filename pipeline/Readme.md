## Security Audit Pipeline
Here we provide code for the different steps of the security audit pipeline. For some steps we use tools provided by [Gitlab]()

Name | Description | Link
--- | --- | ---
SAST | Utilizing the built-in gitlab tools for _Static Application Security Testing_ (SAST) we detect a broad range of known vulnerabilities | [Link to Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/)
Secret Detection | We use the secret detection tools provided by gitlab to check for any accidental leaks of secrets, e.g. private keys for authentication at a station | [Link to Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/pipeline/index.html)
Dependency Scanning | The dependency scanning toolset provided by Gitlab scans the (potentially transitive) dependencies of a project for known vulnerabilities | [Link to Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/)
Disallowlist | The Disallowlist specifies ceratin regex patterns that are not allowed to be contained in the train's code | [Link to files](disallow_list_check)
Compliance Checker | Formats the file and tests whether or not the _padme-conductor_ module is used in the python scripts | [Link to files](compliance_checker)
Image Analysis | Using _Snyk_ we can scan the container image for vulnerabilities | [Link to Documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/getting-started)
DAST | With the _Dynamic Application Security Testing_ (DAST) step we simulate the train in a controlled environment scanning for vulnerabilities at runtime, e.g. communication with a third party server | [Link to files](https://github.com/PADME-PHT/playground/)
Decision Maker | In the last part we make a decision on whether to reject or accept the train based on the results generated by the previous pipeline steps | [Link to files](decision)
